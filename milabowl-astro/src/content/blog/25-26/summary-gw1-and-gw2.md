As all other tech companies the Mila Data Refinement team of MilaCorp are trying out LLMs. This summary is bought to you by GPT-5 🤖!

Two weeks in and the bowl is already boiling. Chaos rules? Absolutely. Logic? Optional. Puns? Mandatory. Let’s speed-run the funniest (and real!) bits from the opening fortnight.

## Gameweek 1 — “New krakk, who dis?” 🧯

Winner: **Med Kunis på krakken** climbed straight onto the, uh, krakken, topping the week. Also nabbed a **HeadBros** handshake for **+2.69** and somehow juggled 3 yellow cards and a small BenchFail without falling off.

- Kunis? More like Win-is. A tidy start plus that HeadBros +2.69 sparkle set the tone.

- Yellow fever! **Med Kunis** banked +3 from YellowCards, then still smiled for the podium photo.

- Following the crowd hurts. **Krakk Under Pressure** paid the TrendyBitch tax (-2) for joining the Isak-in, Foden-out parade. Ouch.

Wooden spoon: **Agil Krakk Rotasjon** mis-homed the missile—CapFailScore (-1) with a low-scoring Palmer armband and the week’s basement spot.

## Gameweek 2 — “Agil gonna Agil” 🌀

Winner: **Agil Krakk Rotasjon** did some very lean rotations indeed—wins the round while tanking a Dynamite bomb (-2) like a champ.

- Boom? Still zoom. **Agil ate Bomb: Dynamite (-2)** and still finished GW2 #1. Peak Milabowl energy.

- **Free Pass, no chill**. Free Pass & Chill kept things squeaky with TightButthole +2.1 (fewest goals conceded)… but also captained Justin Kluivert for 0 (CapFail -1). Comedy is about timing.

- Cocoa with spice. **CensoredCocoaCompany** stirred in a UniqueCap +2 and ladled out 3rd place for the week.

- Sarr today, sorry tomorrow. **Sels Sarr Salaht** slid to 8th (2.19 pts) with nothing trendy or unique to cling to this time.

**Wooden spoon**: Milas krakk hit the floor at 9th—CapFail (-1) with a 0-pointer captain and a BenchFail (-1) to match. We’ve all been there.

## Closing krakks 📉📈

- **Early pace:** Med Kunis set the table in GW1; Agil flipped it in GW2.

- **Uni-vibes:** Lone captains paid off more than once; trends kept handing out parking tickets.

Same time next week—bring snacks, diffusal kits, and maybe… fewer yellow cards? 💛
