# New year, new improvements! 🚀

The holiday break has been productive for Milabowl's tech stack. Here's what's been cooking in the development kitchen:

## Build pipeline with actual standards 🏗️

Finally implemented proper CI/CD with automated testing for the MilaRules engine. The .NET backend now runs tests on every commit and breaks the build on warnings - no more "it works on my machine" moments! CSharpier formatting ensures the code stays pretty, and successful merges automatically deploy to production. 

Because apparently we're a real software company now 💼

## Live feature updates 📡

The biggest addition is live gameweek updates! No more waiting until Tuesday morning to see if your captain hauled or blanked spectacularly. The game state can now be updated mid-gameweek for those sweet, sweet live stats.

Perfect for watching your rank plummet in real-time as your differential picks a yellow card 📉

## Frontend gets the professional treatment ✨

Prettier and ESLint are now enforced in the pipeline because consistent code formatting is apparently important (who knew?). The dashboard also got a shiny new row expander that shows you exactly where your points came from - or in most cases, where they didn't come from.

Click that little chevron to see your beautiful rule breakdown and contemplate your life choices 📊

## Visual glory for the worthy 👑

Added visual enhancements to highlight the top three players because if you're not winning, you might as well admire those who are. Glory to the best players and all that.

Also made dark mode even darker because some of us prefer to suffer in style 🌚

## What's next?

More improvements are always brewing. The goal is to make Milabowl so smooth that the only thing you have to worry about is your actual FPL team performance.

*May your arrows be green and your rank be rising* 📈
